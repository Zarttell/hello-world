# hello-world
Just getting started (again)

My name is Mike, I've been a software developer in the UK for most of the last 30 years specializing in C, C# and a bit of C++. I've been woking mostly in the glass industry, programming for automatic inspection systems. I gave up my job a few years ago for family reasons but am looking to get etablished again soon. I've been playing with python and am looking to evaluate new languages for my own use as a freelance.
